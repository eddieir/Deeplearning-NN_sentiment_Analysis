# Deeplearning-NN_sentiment_Analysis

At this git repository I have upload the code for the deeplearning analysis for two cases:

1. Tweeter analysis on airline sentiment based on the taken data by using keras with NB_START_EPOCHS = 20  and BATCH_SIZE = 512  that referes to the number of epcho and  Size of the batches used in the mini-batch gradient descent

2. The second case is done on the IMDB data which taken from keras.datasets . it has the batch size of 64 and itis using sigmnd mothod, regarding the number of epchos it has 5 epcho that gave the accuracy of 98%.
